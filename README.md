# H1 Personal Website Framework
# H2 Overview
This is a basic website I made as a final portfolio for my ```ECE 1100``` class at Georgia Tech. The website is coded in React javascript, using the react-bootstrap framework. 
It is not very well done, especially in terms of style, but it got the job done for my assignment. The website was deployed using GitHub pages.

# H2 Home Page
The home page contains a picture of me, along with a short description of what the site is, and some contact information. I have removed the phone number just in case, but everything else is accurate. The home page also
has a link to the Georgia Tech website embedded in an image of the GT logo.

# H2 About Page
This page has three sections, devoted to an about me, some short term goals I had set for myself, and what I hoped my career path would be. The image aspect ratios are kind of funky, but
overall in my opinion this page doesn't look too bad.

# H2 Projects
The projects page contains a detailed description of the final project I had to make for this class. I chose to make an attachment for a bike helmet that would work in a similar way to wing mirror lights on
most modern cars. The LEDs light up when someone is standing behind them. I used two time-of-flight sensors to detect distance, hooked up on an I2C bus to an arduino uno. The device didn't work very well,
since the TOF sensors' range ended up being a lot shorter than the documentation led me to belive, but everything apart from that was completely functional.

# H2 Resume
Pretty simple, this page just has an embed of a resume I had to make as a part of this class

# H2 Experience
This was a tab I added to get my word count up to the required amount for the assignment. It contains a description of all of the internships I had held up until this point. I had completed three internships
prior to making this website, two in high school and one just before beginning college.
